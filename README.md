# GPU Computing Contributing Guide

1. **Never work from the master branch.** The master branch will be reserved for our deployable product. When adding a new feature please create a **new branch**. Branch names should always have some type of meaning.
    - Always name branches using the following template initials-method worked on or feature implemented. EX. lg-deleteWindow or lg-addedREADME.
  
2. There is no designated reviewer. Just make sure you get someone to review your code. **This is critical do not merge to the master branch before it's reviewed' unless it's something minor like a comment or a print statement.** Once reviewed have the reviewer merge it to the master branch.

3. When submitting a pull requests please give a brief description of what your changes do and the name of the method you implemented. Also, **once you submitted your pull please request anyone of us to review the code.** This is so we can get notified and easily look over what requests need to get reviewed and approved.

# Tools going to be utilized.

- For our editor to keep consistency we are going to all utilize Visual Studio Code. Here's a link if needed, make sure to utilize it. If you're really against Vscode when pushing files do not upload IDE specific files. <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
- For all new code merges utilize GIT.
  
 That's all there is to it. Let's communicate often and don't hesitate to drop any issues in the Discord. **It's better that we resolve issues earlier rather than later. Let's make this a great Team Project!**
